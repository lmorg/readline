			// string. Basically readline will output the completion suggestions
			// verbatim. This means if your user types "foo" and your suggestion
			// is "foobar" then the result returned will be "foofoobar". So you
			// need to crop the partial string from the suggestions.
			//
			// I do admit this is a rather ugly and solution. In all honesty I
			// don't like this approach much myself however that seems to be
			// how the existing readline APIs function (in Go at least) and thus
			// I wanted to keep compatibility with them when I started writing
			// this alternative. This function has since diverged from them in
			// other ways as I've added more features but I've left this
			// particular anti-pattern in for the sake of minimizing breaking
			// changes. That all said, I fully expect that there might be some
			// weird edge case scenarios where this approach might be required
			// by whoever picks this package up as they might need some more
			// complex completion logic than what I used this for.

	// `line[:pos]` is a string to prefix the tab-completion suggestions. For
	// most use cases this will be the string you're literally just cropped out
	// in the `items[i][pos:]` part of the `append` above. While this does seem
	// unduly complicated and pointless, there may be some instances where this
	// proves a useful feature (for example where the tab-completion suggestion
	// needs to differ from what value it returns when selected). It is also
	// worth noting that any value you enter here will not be entered on to the
	// interactive line you're typing when the suggestion is selected. ie this
	// string is a prefix purely for display purposes.
	//
	// `suggestions` is clearly the tab-completion suggestions slice we created
	// above.
	//
	// I agree having a `nil` in a return is ugly. The rational is you can have
	// one single tab handler that can return either a slice of suggestions or
	// a map (eg when you want a description with the suggestion) and can do so
	// with compile type checking intact (ie had I used an any for the suggestion
	// return). This example doesn't make use of that feature.
	//
	// `TabDisplayGrid` is the style to output the tab-completion suggestions.
	// The grid display is the normal default to use when you don't have
	// descriptions. I will cover the other display formats in other examples.
